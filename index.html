            <p><strong>The Seacret Life of Walter Mitty</strong>, it is my favorite movie in this to 5 recomend movie, which is top tear in my ranking. This film tells the story of Walter Mitty, a man who works in the photography department at Life magazine. He has the ability to enter his own imaginary world, imagining what-ifs he has, and this phenomenon occurs all the time. He needs to create the final cover photo before the magazine is released online. While working on the cover photo for the magazine, he receives a gift from a photographer he's never met but trusts, expressing his gratitude and respect for their work together. He also receives a photo to be used on the cover, but realizes he doesn't have it. With no way to contact him, he decides to track him down using some information he has, traveling to several places, including Everest and Iceland, to find the photographer. I've seen this film many times, and I never tire of the countries and adventures he visits. It's a film that has had a small impact on my own life, as well as the locations he filmed. </p>

             <p>Many people will know this movie. My whole family, including myself, loves it, and it's one of my favorite movies, <strong>The Fast and the Furious</strong>, with its powerful car action, fights, and family love that transcends the series. Each character is unique, crazy, and funny, and at the same time, the bonds that form between each character are what make it such a fascinating movie.</p>

             <p><strong>How to Train Your Dragon</strong> was originally animated and appeared in films and anime, but this year saw its first live-action adaptation. In this world, dragons existed, but for many years they were unable to coexist with humans and were regarded as enemies. One black dragon, however, had existed for many years, but details about it were scarce, making it extremely feared. Among these dragons, the village chief's son, Hiccup, is a thin, weak child among a group of powerful, Viking-like people. He is instructed to flee if a dragon approaches, but he possesses a wisdom not shared by the others, allowing him to strike the black dragon and weaken it. However, Hiccup, who dislikes violence, is unable to kill the dragon, and he watches over it. One day, he is able to communicate with it, and the two become like companions and family. The story follows the dragon as they fly and fight together in a beautiful world. I love this worldview, and even after watching the trailers and other footage, I can see that not all scenes are CGI but were actually shot outdoors. These elements make this film one of my favorites.</p>

            <p><strong>Ford v Ferrari</strong> is a film set at Le Mans, one of the world's most popular car sports, car racing. It's based on true events. Ferrari once dominated Le Mans, and it was said that it would be extremely difficult for other companies to beat them, given their excellent drivers and impressive technology. Ford ultimately beat Ferrari at Le Mans, but this film focuses on one particular driver. The film explores the challenges and betrayals faced by drivers and engineers at Le Mans and other races, and through all of this, it deeply engages the protagonist, as well as his teammates, family, and trusted friends. It's also packed with exciting car races. My feelings and expectations before and after watching this film were completely different.
